This repository contains the models and algorithms I developed to tackle the [AutoNLP Challenge](https://autodl.lri.fr/competitions/35#home), which is a challenge in AutoDL applied to Natural Language Processing.

I have a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/mPoXjG5t/helpful-bookworm) which contains development notes - challenges, solutions and reflections I wrote down when working on the project.
